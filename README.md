BigNum
======

a Big Number in C++ with some Qt libarary 
until now i just used QString and Qdebug from Qt libraries that can replaced with origional cpp classes(string & stream ).

I try to get best memory managment 
so until now this can multiply 10^400 and 10^400

But there is some problem that will be soleved! :
  1- just positive
  2- there is an error in multiply 
  3- there is some error in power and factorial 
  4- there is no division operator
  5- I want to optimize some operator with new algorithm in Data structors
